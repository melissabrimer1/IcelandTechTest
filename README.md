Once downloaded, open up solution in Visual Studio.

Start debugging the project (F5) to run the program.

The process will read the CSV file included in the project which holds the input data. In my experience, this sort of data would be held
within an SQL table and handled using SqlClient, but obviously for simplicity reasons I've avoided SQL.

The console should display both input data and output data, so a side by side comparison of today's outlook and tomorrow's. However,
a CSV file will be produced and found on the desktop displaying the output so that output data is saved.
